        "Ngozi Maduakolam, aka ZTHEPRO, is a Hip-hop, R&B, and Pop record producer/songwriter. He has produced over a dozen published compositions for various artists, with his current biggest record being ‘Crash’. A track released on Grammy Nominated R&B recording artist Mack Wilds’ ‘After Hours’ EP (2017) on Empire Records. As of late 2018 ‘Crash’ has accumulated 1.4 Million streams on Spotify alone. Additionally, ZTHEPRO's top three independently released records have collectively amassed 2.1 Million streams across Youtube, Soundcloud and Spotify; Estimated average stream counts from Amazon Music, Google Play, Tidal and iTunes are at 2.8 Million and counting.",
        "ZTHEPRO’s music can also be found in the motion picture 'The Tale of Four', a short film directed by Academy Award winning actress Gabourey Sidibe. This project, being her first film as a director, features Ledisi Young, Jussie Smollett and Aisha Hinds. The film is synced with ‘Surface Love’, an R&B/Soul record written and sung by Kojo Stone, composed and produced by ZTHEPRO.",
        "Born in Spanish Harlem, in Uptown Manhattan, NY, Ngozi came from humble beginnings, attending schools in the neighborhood. As the fourth son of Nigerian immigrant parents, his family played a vital role in his musical exposure, influence, and style. The Maduakolam family's collection of vinyl records, CDs, and cassettes introduced him to a diverse variety of artists such as Marvin Gaye, U2, Seal, Sade, Michael Jackson, and plenty of Nigerian gospel musicians as well. As a child of the 90s, coming to age in the 2000s, he gravitated to R&B, Hip-hop and Pop radio records, discovering some of his favorite producers like Tim & Bob, Ryan Leslie, B. Cox, Pharrell, Timbaland, Danja Handz, and Rodney Jerkins. These producers have continued to influence ZTHEPRO’s production style up until today. In addition to his work ethic, and drive to be an industry leading music producer, Ngozi has always stressed the importance of a good education. Today he is humbled to be the first professional musician in his family and the first to graduate with a B.A. in Music Technology, which he earned from New York University Steinhardt."
